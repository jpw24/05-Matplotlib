These are the observable trends from the data:

1. Bubble Chart Observations

Urban cities tend to have the most number of rides, and the lowest average fares per ride. Additionally, these cities have more drivers to choose from (this is observable from the size of the bubbles).

Suburban areas tend to have a medium amount of rides, and a medium average fare amount, and medium number of drivers.

Rural areas have the fewest rides, fewest number of drivers (smallest bubbles), and the highest fares.


2. % of Total Fares by City Type:
The urban areas dominate the total fares pie chart. They have the most total fares, and rural areas have the least. Suburban areas have the smallest total fares.

3. % of Total Rides by City Type:
Urban areas, again, tend to dominate the total number of rides, with suburban areas next, and rural areas the least. This makes sense based on the bubble chart we made first.


4. % of Total Drivers by City Type:
Urban areas, again, tend to dominate the total number of drivers, with suburban areas next, and rural areas the least. This makes sense because there is less population..
