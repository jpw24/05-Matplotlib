These are the observable trends from the data:

1. Bubble Chart Observations

Urban cities tend to have the most number of rides, and the lowest average fares per ride. Additionally, these cities have more drivers to choose from (this is observable from the size of the bubbles).

Suburban areas tend to have a medium amount of rides, and a medium average fare amount, and medium number of drivers.

Rural areas have the fewest rides, fewest number of drivers (smallest bubbles), and the highest fares.
